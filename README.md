This is my fifth project for my internship at Prodigy Infotech, where I created a responsive Weather Webapp.This web application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for locations worldwide. Users can simply enter the name of a city or location into the search box and click the search button to retrieve the weather data. The app dynamically updates the display with the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed, along with an icon representing the weather condition (e.g., sun, rain, snow). In case of an invalid or non-existent location, the app gracefully handles errors and prompts the user to try again.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the Weather Webapp leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Its responsive design ensures a seamless experience across various devices. In the future, enhancements such as weather forecasts for multiple days, geolocation detection for displaying local weather, and unit conversion options may be considered. Overall, the Weather Webapp offers a user-friendly interface for accessing current weather information, making it a valuable tool for planning outdoor activities or travel.
